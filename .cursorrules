## Code Style & Standards

### Python Style
- Write idiomatic Python code
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use f-strings for string formatting

### Documentation
- All classes and public methods must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections
- Include examples in docstrings for complex functions

### Error Handling
- Use specific exception types rather than generic Exception
- Always provide meaningful error messages
- Handle database connection errors gracefully
- Log errors with appropriate context

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Organize tests in classes that mirror the main code structure
- Use descriptive test method names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

### Mocking
- Mock external dependencies (database connections, file operations)
- Always verify that mocks are called correctly
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Database Interactions

### Query Guidelines
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Handle database connection errors gracefully
- Always close database connections in finally blocks or use context managers
- Prefer ILIKE for case-insensitive string matching
